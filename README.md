# Python_API_Testv1
In this example, the Python script validate_apis.py defines a list of API URLs to validate. It uses the requests library to send HTTP GET requests to these URLs and checks the response for HTTP errors. The Dockerfile specifies a Python 3.8 base image, sets up a working directory, copies the Python script into the container, installs any required dependencies from a requirements.txt file, exposes port 80 (in case you need to run a web service), and finally runs the Python script when the container is launched.

You can customize the list of API URLs in the Python script and adjust the Dockerfile according to your specific requirements. To build and run the Docker container, follow these steps:

Place the Python script and Dockerfile in the same directory.
Create a requirements.txt file if you have any Python dependencies and list them there.
Build the Docker image using the docker build command.
Run the Docker container with the docker run command.
This setup allows you to validate multiple API URLs within a Docker container, making it easy to manage and deploy your API validation script.

#h2 HOW to RUn the COde 
To run code in the terminal on macOS (Darwin), you can use the Python interpreter, which is included with macOS, or execute other scripts or programs, depending on the language and type of code you have. Here's a basic overview:

1. Running Python Code**:

   If you have Python code, you can execute it in the terminal:

   - Open the Terminal application (you can find it in the "Utilities" folder within "Applications").
   - Navigate to the directory where your Python script is located using the `cd` command.
   - Run the Python script using the `python` command, followed by the script's filename. For example:

     ```bash
     python your_script.py
     ```

   Make sure you replace `your_script.py` with the actual name of your Python script.

2. Running Other Scripts or Programs**:

   If you have code in a language other than Python, the process may vary. For example, if you have a shell script (Bash script), you can execute it directly in the terminal:

   - Navigate to the directory containing your script using `cd`.
   - Run the script by typing its name and pressing Enter.

   Example for a Bash script:

   ```bash
   ./your_script.sh
   ```

   If you have compiled code (e.g., C or C++), you'll need to compile it first, and then you can run the resulting executable.

3. Running Docker Containers:

   If you have a Docker container, you can use the `docker run` command to start it. Make sure Docker is installed on your macOS, and you've built an image and created a container.

   Example:

   ```bash
   docker run -it your-image-name
   ```

   Replace `your-image-name` with the actual name of your Docker image.
